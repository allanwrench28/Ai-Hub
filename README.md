2. Copy and paste these commands one at a time, pressing Enter after each:

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/allanwrench28/Ai-Hub.git
cd Ai-Hub
./setup.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/allanwrench28/Ai-Hub.git
cd Ai-Hub
setup.bat
```

3. **That's it!** Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If the automated setup doesn't work, try this:

1. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)

## üéØ What is AI Hub?

AI Hub is a **simple server** that lets all your AI services (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Grok, etc.) share:
- ‚úÖ Your questions and conversations
- ‚úÖ Context across devices (phone, PC, tablet)
- ‚úÖ Preferences and history

**Why?** So you can start a conversation on your phone and continue it on your PC with full context!

## ‚ú® Features

- üåê **Web Dashboard** - Easy point-and-click interface (no coding needed!)
- üîÑ **Query Sharing** - All AI services can log and access queries
- üìù **Shared Context** - Persistent context across all AI services
- üîç **History** - Access complete conversation history
- üöÄ **Simple API** - Easy integration with any AI service
- üíæ **Local Storage** - All data stays on your computer

---

## üöÄ Using AI Hub

### Web Dashboard (Easiest Way!)

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Use the dashboard to:
   - Log queries
   - View history
   - Update context
   - See statistics

## üéì Real-World Example

**Scenario:** You're building a web app

1. **On your phone (ChatGPT):** "I want to build a REST API"
   - ChatGPT logs this to AI Hub
   
2. **On your PC (Copilot):** Opens your code editor
   - Copilot reads from AI Hub and sees you're working on a REST API
   - Gives you relevant code suggestions!

3. **Later (Grok):** "What are the best practices for REST APIs?"
   - Grok knows the context from previous conversations

**All your AI services working together!**
