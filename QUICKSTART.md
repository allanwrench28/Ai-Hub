# Quick Start Guide

Get your AI Hub running in 3 simple steps!

## Step 1: Install & Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/allanwrench28/Ai-Hub.git
cd Ai-Hub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

You should see:
```
AI Hub server running on port 3000
Visit http://localhost:3000 for API information
```

## Step 2: Test It (1 minute)

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
node examples/test-client.js
```

You should see all tests pass with âœ“ marks.

## Step 3: Use It!

### Scenario: Multi-Device AI Conversations

**On your phone (ChatGPT):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/queries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "I want to build a REST API",
    "source": "chatgpt"
  }'
```

**On your PC (Copilot):**
```bash
# Get context from ChatGPT conversation
curl http://localhost:3000/queries?limit=5

# Now Copilot knows you're working on a REST API!
```

## What Just Happened?

1. âœ… You started a central hub for all AI services
2. âœ… Logged a query from ChatGPT
3. âœ… Retrieved that context from Copilot
4. âœ… Your AI services can now share data!

## Next Steps

- **Read full documentation**: See `README.md`
- **Check integration examples**: Look in `examples/` folder
- **Read detailed usage**: See `USAGE.md`

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Cross-Device Continuity
Start a conversation on your phone, continue on your PC with full context.

### 2. Multi-AI Collaboration
Ask ChatGPT for ideas, have Copilot write the code, use Grok for research - all sharing context.

### 3. Persistent Memory
All your AI conversations are saved and searchable.

## Quick Reference

| What | Command |
|------|---------|
| Start server | `npm start` |
| Test server | `node examples/test-client.js` |
| Add query | `POST /queries` |
| Get queries | `GET /queries` |
| Update context | `POST /context` |
| Get context | `GET /context` |

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

**Can't connect from other devices?**
- Use your computer's IP address instead of `localhost`
- Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`
