# üöÄ Installation Guide for Complete Beginners

This guide is written for people who have **never used a terminal or command line before**. We'll walk you through every single step!

---

## üìã What You'll Need

Before we start, you need two things installed on your computer:

### 1. **Git** (for downloading/cloning the code)

**What is Git?** Git is a tool that lets you download code from the internet (like from GitHub).

**How to get Git:**

- **Windows:** 
  1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
  2. Download will start automatically
  3. Run the installer (click "Next" through all options - the defaults are fine)
  4. After installation, restart your computer

- **Mac:** 
  1. Open the "Terminal" app (find it in Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal)
  2. Type this command and press Enter: `git --version`
  3. If Git isn't installed, macOS will prompt you to install it - click "Install"

- **Linux:** 
  1. Open Terminal
  2. Type: `sudo apt-get install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install git` (Fedora)
  3. Press Enter and type your password when asked

**Check if Git is installed:**
- Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or "Command Prompt" or "Git Bash" (Windows)
- Type: `git --version`
- Press Enter
- You should see something like "git version 2.x.x" ‚úì

### 2. **Node.js** (to run the AI Hub server)

**What is Node.js?** Node.js lets your computer run JavaScript code (which AI Hub is written in).

**How to get Node.js:**
1. Visit https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the **LTS version** (the green button that says "Recommended for Most Users")
3. Run the installer:
   - Windows: Double-click the downloaded file, click "Next" through all options
   - Mac: Double-click the downloaded file, follow the installation wizard
4. After installation, **restart your computer** (important!)

**Check if Node.js is installed:**
- Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or "Command Prompt" (Windows)
- Type: `node --version`
- Press Enter
- You should see something like "v20.x.x" or similar ‚úì
